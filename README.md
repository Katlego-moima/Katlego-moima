# 👋 Hi there, I'm Kat!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a passionate mobile game lover, an avid reader, and a dedicated learner, always seeking new adventures and challenges in the digital world. 🕹️📚

## About Me

- 📱 Mobile Game Enthusiast: I'm an ardent fan of the mobile game "Mobile Legends," and I've been following its journey through all 30 seasons. When I'm not coding or reading, you'll often find me on the battlefield, strategizing with my team.
- 📚 Lifelong Learner: As a junior software developer at The Digital Academy, I'm constantly expanding my horizons. I'm particularly focused on learning React.js and the concepts of functional components. I find that working on mini projects is the best way to grasp new concepts, and I'm always up for a coding adventure.
- 💆‍♀️ Meditation Enthusiast: To relax my mind and stay focused, I incorporate meditation into my daily routine. It's an essential practice that keeps me grounded and helps me approach challenges with a clear perspective.
- 🐍 Next Stop: After grasping React.js, I have my sights set on learning Python. It's a versatile language with a wide range of applications, and I'm excited to explore its possibilities in my journey as a developer.

## Projects I'm Working On

👨‍💻 **Developer Portal**: As part of my role at The Digital Academy, I'm actively involved in the development of the Developer Portal. This project aims to create a user-friendly platform where developers can access resources, documentation, and tools to streamline their work. I'm excited to contribute to this initiative that empowers developers and enhances their experience.

💰 **Donations App**: In my spare time, I'm working on a Donations App. This app is designed to simplify and modernize the donation process for nonprofit organizations. It enables users to make contributions efficiently and allows organizations to manage donations seamlessly. I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact, and this project is my way of giving back to the community.
